# Life-Expectancy

My first project in Data Analysis/Visualization with Python. 
The data (sourced from the WHO, found on Kaggle) is uploaded as .csv, and the notebook can be found as .ipynb and HTML. 
The PNG folder contains the final visualizations made in the analysis.
This was a great exercise, and there is a ton to learn for new/junior programmers!
